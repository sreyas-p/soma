# Assets Directory

This directory contains app assets like icons, splash screens, and images.

For a production app, you would include:
- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

For development purposes, you can use Expo's default assets or create placeholder images.
